## The Problem:
Neural Network models are Resource Intensive. What if we want to deploy this model on a resource constrained device, such as a microcontroller? 

## The Need:
Given a neural network model, we need to have faster inference and lesser memory usage. 

## The Results of this Project:
4x Speedup in inference time (average) and 52% lesser memory usage



# Steps to run the Jupyter Notebook:
## Step 1: unzip/uncompress the dataset
```
Steganography_Dataset.zip 
```
## Step 2: Install the required libraries
```
pip install uv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Step 3:
Run the Jupyter Notebook cell by cell

### NOTE: The application chosen here is Image Classification: Steganography. (whether something is hidden in an image or not). The dataset is taken from IEEE dataport.
